#summary Source code


= Github =
This project has switched to Git for source control. 
The only thing that will be moving for now is the source, all downloads, wiki, and issue tracking will stay here for now.

https://github.com/oysteinkrog/gpusphsim

You can download the source directly from Github or install a Git client, clone the repository, and then keep it up to date by pulling new changes. Binary builds for windows will continue to be posted here on google code. 

Windows users can use msysgit + TortoiseGit for a relatively simple GUI solution for keeping their source up to date.

You can see the old SVN page here:
